**Question 1A:**
```{r Question 1A}
#INSERT CODE HERE
# loading the data 
setwd("/Users/yashasvithanai/Desktop/Simon/Predictive & Causal Analytics/HW 2")

facebookData <- read.csv("Facebook Data.csv")

# running the required regression
facebookDataReg <- lm(clickPerDollar~factor(adType)+factor(category)+factor(placement)+ factor(keywords)+factor(body)+ageMean, facebookData)
summary(facebookDataReg)
```


**Question 1B:**
```{r Question 1B}
#INSERT CODE HERE
#Comment out the line that gives you an error so that you can compile it
# regWithDate <- lm(clickPerDollar~factor(adType)+factor(category)+factor(placement)+ factor(keywords)+factor(body)+ageMean + factor(date), facebookData)
#error returned

#The error is returned as the variable factor(date) contains only one value and canâ€™t be divided into levels of categories. 
```


**Question 1C:**
```{r Question 1C}
#INSERT CODE HERE
levels(factor(facebookData$category)) 
# Cosmetics will be baseline Category
# coefficient of factor(category)General: -45.741606
# CI (-47.44416, -44.039048)

# The coefficient shows that clicksPerDollar will be 45.71416 less for retailers in General category compared to the baseline category Cosmetics. 
# The CI (-47.44416, -44.039) gives the interval of expected difference in clicksperDollar compared to retailers in Cosmetics category.
```

**Question 1D:**
```{r Question 1D}
#INSERT CODE HERE
summary(facebookDataReg) 
# running summary to obtain values
# The coefficient shows that if ageMean increases by 1, clicksPerDollar will increase by 2.5988. 
# The CI (2.559, 2.638) gives the interval of expected change in clicksPerDollar with a unit increase in average age of targeted customers.
```


**Question 2A:**
```{r Question 2A}
#INSERT CODE HERE - WRITTEN ANSWER ON BLACKBOARD
# running the interaction regression 
InteractionRegression <- lm(clickPerDollar~factor(adType)+factor(category)+factor(placement)+ factor(keywords)+factor(body)+ageMean + factor(category)*ageMean, facebookData)
summary(InteractionRegression)
# factor(category)eCom:ageMean coefficient    -0.36125 

#-0.36125 gives the effect of average age on marginal effect of eCom category on clicksPerDollar.  
# If average age increases by 1, the marginal effect of eCom Category would be
# (-28.29490 - 0.35125 = -28.64615) on clicksPerDollar compared to the baseline cosmetics category.

```


**Question 2B:**
```{r Question 2B}
#INSERT CODE HERE 
# marginal effect of factor(Category)eCom 
# in part 1a: (-42.643506)
# in part 2a: (-28.2949 - 0.36125*ageMean)
# In part 1a, clicksPerDollar of retailer from eCom category will have reduced by 42.6435 compared to cosmetics category
# while in part 2a, eCom category will have a difference of (-28.2949 -0.36125*ageMean) from cosmetics. 
# The Category does not depend on avgMean in 1a, but the effect is considered in 2a.
